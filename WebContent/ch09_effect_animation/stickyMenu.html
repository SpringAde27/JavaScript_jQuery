		<p>Handling user uploaded images on your website can be a time consuming task. In this post, 
		we'll show how Cloudinary's cloud-based image management service can help you turn user uploading 
		into a lightweight operation that bypasses your servers altogether. 
		How do you handle user uploads today? 
		If images are uploaded directly to your servers, 
		this requires some heavy server-side processing, 
		bandwidth and storage space. One way to offload images is to transfer them 
		to cloud storage. But if you're handling the upload operation on your own servers
		(and then transferring them to the cloud), this is still wasteful of server resources.
		</p>
		<p>
		A smarter option is to enable uploading of images 
		directly from users' browsers to the cloud. 
		In a previous post, we showed how to do this with Cloudinary's cloud-based image management solution, 
		via our jQuery plugin. We also enable this for mobile apps via the iOS and Android SDKs. 
		But this still requires a small server-side component to handle authentication. 
		Now we're happy to introduce a new option 
		that simplifies the upload process and 
		completely bypasses your servers - Direct unsigned upload. 
		You can now upload directly from the browser or app to Cloudinary with no predefined authentication. 
		Instead, upload options are controlled by centralized configuration. 
		This is easier to implement and is more suitable for modern client-side and mobile apps with a fast, dynamic UI.
		</p>		
		<p>Direct unsigned uploading of images to the cloud: how it works
		Cloudinary is an image management solution that allows you to upload your images to the cloud, 
		perform powerful image manipulations on-the-fly, and deliver them to users via a fast CDN. 
		Previously, we required that all images uploaded are signed with your account's API secret. 
		Now, you can call Cloudinary's upload API without signing with your API secret (we call this 'unsigned'). 
		This allows you to perform upload directly from a browser or mobile app without going through your servers at all. 
		For security reasons, not all upload parameters can be specified directly when performing unsigned upload calls.
		First, you need to enable unsigned uploading for your Cloudinary account from the Upload Settings page. 
		If you don't have a Cloudinary account already, you can set it up for free.
